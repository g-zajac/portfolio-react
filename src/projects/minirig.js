          <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
          <p>
            I used for top and side lights RGBW LED strips enclosured in black aluminium profile with diffusing cover. Those LEDs cover geral basic rig and can be controled with just a few DMX chanels. For special fixtures I designed minature 3D printed units.
