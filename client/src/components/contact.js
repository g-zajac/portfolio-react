            Grzegorz is independent electronic engineer based in Berlin. He is
            passionate and experienced in technology and theatre. Grzegorz
            received MSc in 2003 in Electronics/Electro-acoustics from Wroclaw
            University of Technology, Poland. After the sixteen-year theatre
            career, as a sound engineer in Opera (Wroclaw, PL) and technician in
            Trinity Laban (London, UK), Grzegorz began to work as an independent
            engineer to provide digital innovation and create theatre magic.
            When he isnâ€™t glued to a computer screen or soldering iron, he
            spends time as a dad and a boater.
