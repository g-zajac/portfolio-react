          Grzegorz is independent electronic engineer based in Berlin. He is
          passionate and experienced in technology and theatre. Grzegorz
          received MSc in 2003 in Electronics/Electro-acoustics from Wroclaw
          University of Technology, Poland. After the sixteen-year theatre
          career, as a sound engineer in Opera (Wroclaw, PL) and technician in
          Trinity Laban (London, UK), Grzegorz began to work as an independent
          engineer to provide digital innovation and create theatre magic. When
          he isnâ€™t glued to a computer screen or soldering iron, he spends time
          as a dad and a boater.
