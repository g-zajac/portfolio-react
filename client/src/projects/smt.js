          <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
          <p>
            I designed, programmed and built a mini multimedia server based on
            Raspberry Pi 3 board with UPS board and Enttec USB2DMX modules. The
            server were controlling lights, sound and sensor. I used minimal
            headless version of Debian operating system with QLC+ and Node-Red
            applications installed. QLC+ run lights sequence and playback sound
            track. The Node-Red controlls sensor, triggering lights cues, sound
            cues, schedule, system monitoring, diagnostic MQTT messaging etc.
            QLC+ was linked with Node-red over OSC. The server run the
            exhibition for over half a year faultless. The MQTT messagaes were
            subscribed and stored in a cloud database. Counter and visit chart
            are generated with grafana from stored data.
